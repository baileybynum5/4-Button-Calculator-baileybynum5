Create a program that behaves as a 4 button calculator. 
This program should ask the user:

> Do you want to perform another calculation? 

after one calculation is complete.  

If they answer yes, start the program over if they say no, end the program.
**Every operation should be a function.**


The display should look like this when you run the program (but of course the numbers would not have to be 5 and 7):

> What operation do you want to perform?
> 1. Add
> 2. Subrtact
> 3. Multiply
> 4. Divide

> 2

> What is the first number?
> 5
> What is the second number?
> 7
> The answer is: 12
